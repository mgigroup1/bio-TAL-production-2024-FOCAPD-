This research article, presented at the Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design (FOCAPD) 2024 conference in Breckenridge, Colorado, explores innovative routes to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the bio-production of Triacetic Acid Lactone (TAL). The study employs techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the viability and sustainability of producing TAL using conventional glucose and a novel co-feeding approach with formic acid and Yarrowia lipolytica.

Key insights:

TAL, traditionally derived from petroleum, can be sustainably produced from renewable biomass or CO2-derived feedstocks.
The research compares different technology scenarios to identify the most cost-effective and sustainable production methods.
Utilizing CO2 emissions from the bioreactor as a feedstock for formic acid production shows potential for achieving net-negative CO2 emissions.
The study demonstrates the benefits of CO2 recycling, with a minimal increase in the minimum selling price (MSP) compared to traditional methods but significant environmental gains.
